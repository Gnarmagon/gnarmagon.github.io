You may have already heared about it or not ? that the Nintendo Switch had some huge breaktroughs in terms of hacking and after the 34c3 I am pretty sure, that the Switch will be fully open to piracy and homebrew in 2018 and that could have some major influence on sales and developers that could skip (again) the Nintendo Switch... :(

###So what exactly did happen on the 34c3 ? (You can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbtGz8dHKc))

TL;DW:

On the 34c3 showed [@Plutoo](https://twitter.com/qlutoo), [@Derrek](https://twitter.com/derrekr6) and [@Naerwert](https://twitter.com/naehrwert), what they already archived on the Nintendo Switch and to be honest, it is really impressive to hack a Console in the first year down to the Trustzone O.O.They sadly won't release the Kernel exploit but it seems like that there will be someone who will release a full loaded Kexploit.

### What's happening now ?

We got teased by Team Xecuter, a team famouse for their Xbox360 Modchips, who teased something (I guess it will be a modchip) for the Nintendo Switch, that will be "unpatchable" by software so they are essentially saying they will release a Hardmod that will enable running unsigned Code...They also linked a Key to decrypt boot2 that is actually legit and I think that this Hardmod is the glitchhack shown at 34c3....As a proof for everyone else who isn't skilled enough they also made a Video of a Nintendo Switch booting with "XECUTER".

### Should I buy this ?

To be honest I have no influence on you decissions but after Nintendo went to the Supreme Court about DS Flashcarts, resulting in making everything that bypasses security mechanisms (to allow Piracy) illegal.So now you shouldn't buy one if you don't want to go to jail, just wait for some neat softwarehacks, also if you don't break your Switch when installing the Hardmod you will most likely shorten the livespan of your console and you risk getting banned from Nintendo Network that can't be reverted.

Have a nice day everyone and this is my first real "blogpost" that counts more like a test than an actual post XD
