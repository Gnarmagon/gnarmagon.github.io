# Hello World Guys :)
It's seems to get better :/

I mean I installed [Typora](https://www.typora.io/#windows) now and it's working so good <3

Now I only have learn Markdown Syntax, make Assets, configure my Page 

and add Emoji support.

Edit: 

I screwed Emoji/will hopefully not use them (they look so pixelated)

and the only thing I found was a tool that extracts (mac only) the 			   emojis for a "fallback" if the browser doesn't support emoji :/
